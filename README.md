## Big Time with Japanese Days watchface


Implemented by Tom Fukushima forked from the code of the Revolution watchface by Douwe Maan.

I found the fonts of the Revolution watchface a little hard to read so I made the following modifications:
* Changed the fonts to the Ubuntu San Serif font available in Gimp
* Removed the leading zeros for hours and months
* Changed the day of the week to use a larger font for English days of the week.
* Removed the animations for when the hours and minutes change

Notifies when watch loses connection to the phone. It will vibrate and then the display will use inverted colors/white background. Once the phone is reconnected the screen will go back to normal.
