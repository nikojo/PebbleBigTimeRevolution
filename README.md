## BigTimeRevolution watchface


Implemented by Tom Fukushima forked from the code of the Revolution watchface by Douwe Maan.

I found the fonts of the Revolution watchface a little hard to read so I made the following modifications:
* Changed the fonts to the Ubuntu San Serif font available in Gimp
* Removed the leading zeros for hours and months
* Changed the day of the week to use the characters for the Japanese days of the week
